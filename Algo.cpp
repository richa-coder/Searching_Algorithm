// with a linked list the splicing operation required to restructure the list and send the item to the front is quick and trivial.or a linked data structure, moving an item to a new position over large distances has a constant time complexity, O(1), whereas for contiguous memory such as an array, the time complexity is O(N) where N is the range of items being shifted.
